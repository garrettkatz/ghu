Code used to generate results and figures in the paper:

"Reinforcement-based Program Induction in a Neural Virtual Machine"

We ran these experiments on a workstation with an 8-core Intel i7 CPU, 32GB of RAM, Fedora 30, Python 3.7.4, numpy 1.16.2, matplotlib 3.0.3, and pytorch 1.1.0.  With this configuration, the experiments took a matter of hours, with the longest experiments running and finishing overnight.  In a different configuration it may take longer or run out of memory.

The simplest script you can try is echo.py.  This will run one learning trial of the simplest echo task, with very small memory footprint, in a few seconds.

The paper figures were generated by the following scripts:
echo_experiments.py -> Figs 2,3
swap_experiments.py -> Figs 4,5
filter.py, rfilter.py, then plot_filters.py -> Fig 6
max.py, then plots.py -> Fig 7

For figs 8-10, we did individual runs of recall_plastic.py and reverse_with_repeats.py, which save results in pickle files with the same names and .pkl extension.  We manually prepended "_0", "_1", etc. to the filenames and then moved them to respective sub-directories of results/.  Finally, we used big_experiments.py to load the data and generate the plots.
